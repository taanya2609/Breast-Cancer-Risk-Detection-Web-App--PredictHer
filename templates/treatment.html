        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <p>Breast cancer treatment methods vary based on the type and stage of cancer, as well as individual patient factors. Common treatment options include surgery, such as lumpectomy (removing the tumor) or mastectomy (removing the entire breast). Radiation therapy is often used after surgery to destroy remaining cancer cells. Chemotherapy involves the use of powerful drugs to kill cancer cells and is typically recommended for aggressive or advanced cases. Hormone therapy helps block hormones like estrogen that fuel certain types of breast cancer. Targeted therapy focuses on specific molecules involved in cancer growth, while immunotherapy boosts the body's immune system to fight the disease. In many cases, a combination of these treatments is used to achieve the best outcome.</p>
